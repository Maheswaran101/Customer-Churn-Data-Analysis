# Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn behavior using historical telecom data. By applying data preprocessing techniques, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models, the goal is to identify key drivers of churn and offer actionable insights to reduce customer attrition.

🧠 Problem Statement
Customer churn significantly affects profitability in subscription-based industries. Understanding the underlying factors behind churn enables businesses to take proactive measures, improve retention, and personalize customer engagement.

🛠️ Key Steps
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized feature formats
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify churn patterns, trends, and correlations
- Feature Engineering: Transformed categorical features, created new interaction variables, and applied scaling
- Modeling: Built classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
- 
📈 Highlights
- Visualized churn rate across customer segments
- Identified top churn predictors using feature importance and SHAP values
- Compared model performance to select the most effective churn prediction strategy
